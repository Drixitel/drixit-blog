These are my tabby cats. They were found in a dumpster and I love them. They also know tricks like sit, turn around, up, paw, and explain how magnets work.

So much thought behind those eyes. He's definitely borrowing his cousin Goose's brain cell. Goose is an orange tabby cat.

She's your guide. She will tell you the way. She also has asthma - I didn't know cat's could get asthma.
