As Chat & Tech officer, I noticed new students struggled to engage with visiting speakers.
My solution? Event pages with more than just logistics.

Each page included speaker bios, contact info, and event details-- but also
curated conversation starters that gave shy students entry points into discussions and
helped fill awkward silences. The result? Students came prepared and conversations flowed naturally.

Sometimes the best tech solutions just help people connect better. :]
