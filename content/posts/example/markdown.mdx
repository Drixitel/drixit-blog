# Markdown works here too

Markdown can be written an `.mdx` file and used as content
within these pages. This content is coming from the `markdown.mdx`
file in the example blog post directiry.

Examine that file to see how the following content is written.

## What can markdown do here?

### Write HTML/JSX directly

<h5>HTML works here</h5>

import OtherMarkdown from "./baby-markdown.mdx";
import { Descriptors } from "@/components/descriptors";

The content with the red border is coming from other files, and
are referenced in the MDX file using JSX.

<div className='py-4 border border-red-500'>
  We can import JSX components from other files and use them here:

<div className="py-4 bg-muted">
  <Descriptors />
</div>

We can even import other markdown files and use them here:

  <div className='py-4 bg-muted'>
    <OtherMarkdown />
  </div>
</div>

### Write LaTeX expressions inline:

$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

And in display mode:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&(n-1)(n-1)\\\
&=n^2-2n+1
\end{aligned}
$$

### You can write code blocks here

```index.js
// this is a JavaScript code block
const saltyDuckEgg = "chinese preserved food product";
```

Try highlighting lines 9-12 in code blocks:

```main.py
# focus(9:12)
def print_nums(nums):
    for num in nums:
        print(num)

_nums = []

_input = 1

while input > 0:
    _input = input("Enter a non-negative number. Enter a negative to quit: ")
    if _input > 0:
        nums.append(_input)

print_nums(_nums)
```

### You can write tables here

| Number | Title                                    | Year |
| :----- | :--------------------------------------- | ---: |
| 1      | Harry Potter and the Philosopherâ€™s Stone | 2001 |
| 2      | Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets  | 2002 |
