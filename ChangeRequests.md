# Changes
1. Remove: `I am a __ `
2. Change Header: `Check out my latest Posts!`
    - `My odds and ends`
3. Can I have 2 views 
    - Keep the 1st `My odds and ends`
    - add : `Portfolio`
4. Can the views horizontally scroll as well as have the "check out the rest" option? 

5. Where can I add my socials: 
    - Discord 
    - Linkedin 

6. Could we change the blog short view 
    - I don't like that it grabs the text and mashes it together like this
    - I would prefer it retain some of the variation i.e. title vs normal txt 
    - Or maybe it tries to show an image? or show the description?
